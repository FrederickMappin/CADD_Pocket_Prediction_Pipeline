# NF-Pocket Prediction

nf-pocket prediction is a workflow designed to allow robust usage of P2rank and fpocket for protein pocket predicitions. The fpocket suite of programs is a very fast open source protein pocket detection algorithm based on Voronoi tessellation. P2Rank is a stand-alone command-line program for fast and accurate prediction of ligand-binding sites from protein structures. It achieves high prediction success rates without relying on external software for computation of complex features or on a database of known protein-ligand templates.
The pipeline is built using Nextflow, a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.
